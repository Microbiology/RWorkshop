# R Workshop
A repo containing the materials for the R workshop.

# Abstract
Statistical methods are one of the cornerstones of the biological sciences. Statistics and computational techniques are becoming increasingly important in light of “big data” availability and the advent of advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence methods. Although there are many available statistical tools available for accomplishing these tasks, few are as widely used or robust as the freely available R statistical programming environment. Ranked the fifth most popular programming language of 2016 by IEEE spectrum, R is a programatic powerhouse that allows the user to perform complex statistics and data visualization. Complex tasks are made more accessible to general users through the more than nine thousand additional open source packages that supplement the base language. Because of its strength, an understanding of R is becoming an increasingly attractive skill for the job market. This workshop will provide an introduction to R that requires no previous programming experience. The topics will include an introduction to R, data analysis, and data visualization.
