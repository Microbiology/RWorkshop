# UPennRWorkshop
A repo containing the materials for the GTV and Dermatology R workshop at UPenn.

- The R script above contains the code we used to guide our discussion throughout the workshop.
- I wrote the notes into an R markdown folder for easier viewing. You will be interested in viewing the html file, which will have both the workshop code, as well as the R output.
